# Queue Implementation in C++
This is a templated implementation of a Queue data structure, implemented using a singly-linked list. It supports the standard queue operations such as push, pop, front, back, size, and empty. It also provides comparison operators for comparison with other queues.
The queue class is a template class, which means it can hold any data type.

## Getting Started

* To use this queue implementation, simply include the queue.hpp header file in your code: `#include "queue.hpp"`
* Then, you can create a queue of any type by specifying its template parameter, for example: `queue<int> my_queue;`
